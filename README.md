# hello-world
My first repository. A part of startup tutorial.
I was a bit conservative till now, but now I see the vast world and a lot of 
opportunities and I am fascinated about them. Github is one of my efforts to explore this vast world.
As far as coding goes I love to program in Python. I also know C, C++ and Java along with it.
